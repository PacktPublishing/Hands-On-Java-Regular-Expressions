## About the Video Course
Regular expressions (Regex) are specially encoded text strings, which are used as patterns for matching sets of strings. The search pattern can be anything from a simple character, a fixed string, or a complex expression containing special characters describing the pattern. IT can also be used to search, edit, and manipulate text.

This course will help you get up and running with Regular expressions in Java 12. You’ll begin with the basics of Regular Expressions (Regex), which covers the topics with a hands-on approach. We’ll also cover the prerequisites required such as JUnit. With the help of practical Java Regex examples, get complete insights into the rules to write regular expressions. You will use regular expressions with String methods and cover Pattern and Matcher for advanced regular expressions.

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to master Regular Expressions with Java 12 Regex API.
